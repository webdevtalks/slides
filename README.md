# Web Dev Talks Slides Repository

Welcome to the Web Dev Talks Slides Repository! This repository is created and maintained by Web Dev Talks (WDT), a technological community proud from Colima, Mexico.

Our community organizes web development talks where experts in the field share their knowledge and experience with fellow web developers. These talks cover a variety of topics related to web development, including web design, front-end development, back-end development, and more. We hold a session on the last Wednesday of each month.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a historical record of each session and the slides/presentations used by each speaker. By doing so, we hope to create a valuable resource for all web developers, whether they attended the talks or not.
